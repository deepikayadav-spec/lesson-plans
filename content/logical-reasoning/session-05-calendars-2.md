## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. State the calendar advancement rule: a normal year shifts the weekday pattern by 1 day, a leap year by 2 days. *(REMEMBERING)*
2. Apply the repetition shortcuts (leap+1 → 6 years, leap+2 → 11 years, leap+3 → 11 years, leap→leap → 28 years) to find when a year's calendar repeats. *(APPLYING)*
3. Explain why the shortcuts are derived from the advancement rule, not memorised as arbitrary numbers. *(UNDERSTANDING)*
4. Identify when the standard repetition shortcuts break down — specifically across non-leap century years (1800, 1900, 2100). *(EVALUATING)*

## Classroom Settling (0–3 min) · Buffer — not instructional

Board ready. Keep last session's leap year rule visible or rewrite it as a header.

## Warm-Up Poll — Retrieval Practice on Session 4 (3–7 min) · ALS: Polling

Say: *"Five quick ones from last session."*

**Q1.** Is 1900 a leap year?
`A` Yes · `B` No
→ *Read:* B should dominate now. If not, re-drill the century exception before moving on — today's session depends on it.

**Q2.** A normal (non-leap) year has how many odd days?
`A` 0 · `B` 1 · `C` 2 · `D` 7
→ *Read:* B is correct.

**Q3.** A leap year has how many odd days?
`A` 1 · `B` 2 · `C` 3 · `D` 7
→ *Read:* B is correct.

**Q4.** Quick mind game: if your birthday falls on a Tuesday this year, what's your gut guess for how many years until it's a Tuesday again — 3, 6, or 11?
`A` 3 years · `B` 6 years · `C` 11 years · `D` Not sure
→ *Read:* Don't confirm — all three are possible answers depending on leap-year positioning, which is exactly today's topic.

**Q5.** How confident are you spotting a leap year on sight now?
`A` Very confident · `B` Getting there · `C` Still shaky
→ *Read:* If C dominates, open Teaching Block A with one more leap-year drill before the repetition rules.

**Running it** — poll tool, ~45 s per question, ~3.75 min total.

---

## Hook (7–10 min)

Say: *"Back to the mind game from the poll — your birthday's on a Tuesday this year. When's the next Tuesday birthday? Most people guess a round number like 5 or 10. The real answer is always one of exactly three numbers: 6, 11, or 28. Which one depends entirely on one thing — how close you are to the nearest leap year. By the end of today you'll know instantly which of the three applies, for any year."*

## Teaching Block A (10–19 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

<!-- placement: inferred grouping — no source deck; grouped from GitBook Concept Explanation extraction -->
Covers: the advancement rule → where the 6/11/11/28 shortcuts come from → worked example.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **The advancement rule — the foundation for everything today.** *"A normal year pushes every date's weekday forward by 1 day. A leap year pushes it forward by 2 days."* This is exactly the odd-days idea from Session 4, just renamed for this context.
- **Why the calendar "repeats" at all.** A year's calendar (which dates fall on which weekdays) repeats exactly when the *total* accumulated shift since that year equals a multiple of 7 — because 7 days brings you back to the same weekday.
- **Derive the shortcuts live, don't just state them:**
  - From a leap year, +1 year later (still non-leap): shift so far = 2 (the leap year's own jump) + 1 = 3. Not yet 7. Keep counting — by +6 years later, total accumulated shift crosses back to a multiple of 7 (accounting for one more leap year encountered along the way) → **repeats after 6 years**.
  - From a leap year, +2 years later: similar accumulation, but the next nearby leap year sits differently in the count → **repeats after 11 years**.
  - From a leap year, +3 years later: → also **repeats after 11 years**.
  - **Leap year to leap year:** the calendars of two leap years match only after the shifts fully re-align, which takes → **28 years** (this is also exactly the length of the pre-Gregorian-exception leap cycle: 4 × 7).
- **Say plainly:** *"You don't need to re-derive these every time — but knowing *why* 28 shows up (4 years per leap cycle × 7 weekdays) means you'll never confuse it with 6 or 11 under pressure."*
- **Worked example, live (from the source, verified):** *"When will the calendar of 2022 repeat?"*
  1. Is 2022 a leap year? No.
  2. Find the nearest preceding leap year: **2020**.
  3. 2022 = 2020 + 2 → this is the **leap+2** case.
  4. Leap+2 repeats after **11 years**.
  5. 2022 + 11 = **2033**. **The calendar of 2022 repeats in 2033.**

**Checkpoint (at 19 min)** — 10 s silent think, cold-call two students:
> *"2021 is a non-leap year. What offset case is it, and when does its calendar repeat?"*
> **Answer:** 2021 = 2020 + 1 → **leap+1** case → repeats after **6 years** → **2027**.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 1 — Whiteboard Race: Find Your Birthday Twin Year (19–25 min)

**ALS format:** Paired Whiteboard Race — pairs race to find the repeat-year for an assigned year, tying directly back to the Hook's birthday framing. Chosen to convert the just-derived shortcuts into fast recall before Teaching Block B introduces the century-exception trap.

**Setup line:**
> *"Pairs, boards up. I'll call a year — find its offset case (leap+1, leap+2, leap+3, or leap-to-leap) and the year its calendar repeats. First correct board up wins the round. Three rounds."*

- Round 1: **2023** — nearest leap 2020, offset +3 → leap+3 → 11 years → **repeats 2034**.
- Round 2: **2024** — 2024 is itself a leap year, next leap-to-leap match → 28 years → **repeats 2052**.
- Round 3: **2019** — nearest leap 2016, offset +3 → leap+3 → 11 years → **repeats 2030**.

**How it surfaces:** After each round, have the winning pair state out loud which offset case they used and why — this is the step most likely to be skipped under time pressure.

**Debrief line:**
> *"Every single one of these came down to one question first: how far is this year from the nearest leap year? Get that right, and the rest is just table lookup."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut to 2 rounds (drop Round 3), but always require the "offset case" to be stated out loud before the final answer.

---

## Teaching Block B (25–32 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

Covers: the century-exception pitfall — where the standard shortcuts break.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **The trap, stated directly:** *"Every one of today's shortcuts assumes leap years follow the simple 4-year rhythm — 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028. But you already know from Session 4 that this rhythm breaks at century years like 1900 and 2100, which are NOT leap years despite being divisible by 4."*
- **What actually happens across a broken century:** the "missing" leap year (e.g. 1900 should have been leap by the simple 4-year rule but isn't) means one expected 2-day jump doesn't happen — the accumulated shift is 1 day short of what the standard 6/11/11/28 shortcuts assume.
- **Worked illustration, live:** *"Does the calendar of 1896 (a real leap year) repeat exactly 28 years later, in 1924?"*
  1. Normally: leap-to-leap → 28 years → expect 1896 + 28 = 1924 to match.
  2. But check every year in between for a century exception: **1900 sits inside this range, and 1900 is NOT leap.**
  3. Because 1900 "skipped" its expected leap jump, the accumulated shift across this span is off by exactly 1 day — so **1896 and 1924 do NOT share the same calendar**, even though the naive 28-year rule says they should.
- **Standing rule to give students:** *"Before trusting any of today's shortcuts, check whether a century year falls inside your date range. If it does, check whether that century year is actually divisible by 400. If it isn't, add one extra day of shift manually — don't trust the shortcut blindly."*

**Checkpoint (at 32 min)** — cold-call:
> *"Would the 28-year leap-to-leap rule work correctly going from 2000 to 2028? Why or why not?"*
> **Answer:** **Yes, it works correctly** — because 2000 IS divisible by 400, it's a true leap year, and no "broken" century (like 1900) falls between 2000 and 2028. The rule only breaks when a non-leap century year sits inside the range.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 2 — Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal: True or False? (32–40 min)

**ALS format:** Silent Solve, Vote-Lock, Then Reveal — students commit to a True/False judgment plus reasoning before the answer is discussed. Deliberately different register from Activity 1's loud paired race (quiet, individual, reasoning-focused), and targets the single most exam-relevant trap in this topic.

**Setup line:**
> *"One statement, on your own, ninety seconds. 'A leap year's calendar always repeats exactly 28 years later, with no exceptions.' True or False — and if false, write down what breaks it. Hold up your answer when I say show."*

Give 90 seconds silent work, then: *"Show me — three, two, one, show."*

**The reveal, step by step:**
1. The statement is **False**.
2. It breaks specifically when a **century year that is divisible by 100 but NOT by 400** (e.g. 1800, 1900, 2100) falls anywhere inside the 28-year span being checked.
3. That century year "should" be leap by the simple 4-year rule but isn't — so one expected 2-day jump is missing, and the accumulated shift ends up 1 day off from what the 28-year rule assumes.
4. Worked check: **1896 → 1924 does NOT repeat** (1900 breaks it), but **1972 → 2000 DOES repeat** (no broken century year in that range).

**Debrief line:**
> *"Every shortcut you learn in this topic has exactly one blind spot — century years. Build the habit of checking for one every single time, and you'll never fall into this trap in an exam."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, skip the second worked check (1972→2000) but always deliver the core reveal — the statement is false, and century years are why.

## Classroom Quiz (40–45 min) · Reserved — not yet available

No quiz bank exists yet for Logical Reasoning. Use this slot for instructor-led review — pose one more century-boundary case (e.g. "does 1996 repeat in 2024?") and solve it together — or fold into Buffer and end early.

## Exit Ticket + Homework (45–48 min)

**Exit ticket** (~1 min):

> A non-leap year is 1 year after the nearest leap year. When does its calendar repeat, and give one example year.
> **Answer:** Leap+1 case → repeats after **6 years**. Example: 2021 (2020+1) → repeats **2027**.

Scan responses on the way out — if the offset-case identification step is shaky, revisit briefly at the start of Session 6 (Data Interpretation begins a new topic, so this is a light check, not a full re-teach).

**Homework**

| Task | Note |
|---|---|
| Find the repeat year for 2025 and for 2026 | Self-check using the offset-case method |
| Check whether 1800's calendar repeats in 1828 (28 years later) | Self-check — should reveal the century-exception break, same logic as the 1896→1924 example |

Tell them: *"That completes the Calendars arc — finding any date's weekday, and now finding when a whole year repeats. Session 6 moves into Data Interpretation — reading and calculating from tables."*

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Why students hold it | Correct it live by |
|---|---|---|
| The repeat-year shortcuts (6/11/11/28) are arbitrary numbers to memorise | Taught as a lookup table without derivation | Teaching Block A's explicit "why 28 shows up" derivation |
| The 28-year rule always works for any two leap years | Feels like a clean, universal pattern | Teaching Block B + Activity 2's century-exception reveal |
| A century year divisible by 4 is automatically leap | Overgeneralising the simple 4-year rule without the 100/400 exception | Poll Q1 + explicit standing rule to always check century years |
| Offset case only matters for "which formula," not "why" | Shortcuts feel like plug-and-chug once learned | Explicit requirement in Activity 1 to state the offset case reasoning aloud, not just the final year |
| Any two years with the same offset-case number will repeat identically regardless of era | Doesn't account for century exceptions falling inside the range | Teaching Block B's 1896→1924 counter-example |

## Instructor Notes

- **Data note:** no source slide deck exists. Content sourced from GitBook Concept Explanation/Introduction/Closure text extraction. GitBook's "Problem Solving" sub-page is image-only and unrecoverable — all worked/practice problems in this plan are **instructor-authored**.
- **Repetition rule verified against source:** the 2022→2033 worked example (leap+2 → +11 years) matches the source's own stated example exactly.
- **Century-exception content (Teaching Block B, Activity 2) is instructor-added, not from the source extraction** — the source's Ideal Format page mentions "common pitfalls and mistakes" without detailing them; this plan supplies the single most exam-relevant pitfall (century-year breaks) grounded directly in the leap year rule already taught in Session 4.
- **50-min format: 45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling, 2 min flex).
- **Two ALS activities, different registers:** Activity 1 (Paired Whiteboard Race) is fast/competitive; Activity 2 (Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal, True/False + reasoning) is quiet/individual and reasoning-focused.
- **Last of the two Calendars sessions** — Session 6 begins a new topic (Data Interpretation) with a diagnostic-style opening, not deep retrieval.
- Classroom Quiz slot reserved-empty per site convention.
