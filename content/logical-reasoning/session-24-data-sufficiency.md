# Session 24 — Data Sufficiency: Enough Information, Not the Answer

**Duration** 50 min total — **45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling at the start, 2 min flex at the end) · **Topic** Judging whether given statements are sufficient to answer a question, without solving it — the five standard answer options · **Prerequisite** None specific — draws on general familiarity with earlier Logical Reasoning topics (arrangements, ranking) for its worked examples; final session of the course
**Session type** Lecture + guided practice. No source slide deck — content from GitBook Concept Explanation text. No classroom quiz bank yet — 5-min slot reserved at end. GitBook "Problem Solving" page is image-only and unrecoverable — all practice problems below are instructor-authored. · **Format** 50-min recalibrated, 2 ALS activities

**Note on worked examples:** the source's own quantitative example (LCM of A:B ratio 3:4, given HCF) contains an internal inconsistency in the extracted text — the ratio appears to be part of the question stem, which would make Statement I alone already sufficient, contradicting the source's stated "individually insufficient" framing. This plan uses fresh, independently-verified examples instead for all five answer-option types, flagged accordingly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Explain the core shift in Data Sufficiency questions — judging sufficiency, not calculating a final answer. *(UNDERSTANDING)*
2. State and correctly apply all five standard answer options. *(REMEMBERING)*
3. Apply the three-step evaluation approach (Statement I alone, Statement II alone, then together) to a problem. *(APPLYING)*
4. Distinguish "possible" from "sufficient" — recognising when multiple valid values remain, sufficiency has not been achieved. *(EVALUATING)*

## Classroom Settling (0–3 min) · Buffer — not instructional

Board ready. Write the five answer options as a running checklist for the whole session.

## Warm-Up Poll — Diagnostic (3–7 min) · ALS: Polling

> New topic — Data Sufficiency doesn't build directly on Puzzles, so this poll is diagnostic, not retrieval, though its worked examples draw on earlier topics.

Say: *"Five quick questions before we start."*

**Q1.** If a number is divisible by both 2 and 3, can you conclude it's divisible by 6, without knowing the number itself?
`A` Yes · `B` No · `C` Not sure
→ *Read:* A is correct — this is the Hook, don't fully explain yet.

**Q2.** In Data Sufficiency, is your job to find the final numeric answer?
`A` Yes, always · `B` No — just judge whether you COULD find it
→ *Read:* B is correct — this is the entire topic's core shift.

**Q3.** If Statement I alone gives you three different possible values for X, is Statement I sufficient?
`A` Yes · `B` No
→ *Read:* B is correct — multiple possibilities always mean insufficient.

**Q4.** How many standard answer options are there in a typical Data Sufficiency question?
`A` 3 · `B` 4 · `C` 5
→ *Read:* C is correct.

**Q5.** How comfortable are you stopping yourself from fully solving a problem, once you've determined it's sufficient?
`A` Very uncomfortable, I want to finish solving · `B` Okay with practice · `C` Comfortable
→ *Read:* If mostly A, this session's core discipline (judge, don't solve) needs extra emphasis.

**Running it** — poll tool, ~45 s per question, ~3.75 min total.

## Hook (7–10 min)

Say: *"If someone tells you a number is divisible by both 2 and 3 — without telling you the number itself — can you still figure out whether it's divisible by 6?"*

Give 20 seconds, then confirm: *"Yes — because 2 and 3 share no common factors, any number divisible by both is automatically divisible by their product, 6. You never needed to know the actual number."*

> *"That's the entire mindset shift today. Every topic so far in this course ended with you calculating a specific answer. Today, you're going to deliberately stop yourself BEFORE solving — because the question isn't 'what's the answer,' it's 'do I have enough to get one.'"*

## Teaching Block A (10–19 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

<!-- placement: inferred grouping — no source deck; grouped from GitBook Concept Explanation extraction -->
Covers: the five standard answer options → the three-step evaluation method → a fully worked "together sufficient" example.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Five standard answer options, write on the board exactly like this:**
  1. **Statement I alone is sufficient** (II is not needed).
  2. **Statement II alone is sufficient** (I is not needed).
  3. **Both statements together are sufficient** (neither alone works).
  4. **Either statement alone is sufficient** (I alone works, AND II alone also works, independently).
  5. **Neither statement, even together, is sufficient.**
- **Three-step evaluation method, write on the board:**
  1. **Assess Statement I alone** — cover up Statement II entirely, ask: does I alone give one single, definite answer?
  2. **Assess Statement II alone** — cover up Statement I entirely, ask the same question.
  3. **Only if both fail alone, assess them together** — combine the information and check again.
- **Worked example, live (instructor-verified, "together sufficient"):** *"Find the values of two numbers, A and B."* Statement I: *"A + B = 20."* Statement II: *"A − B = 4."*
  1. Statement I alone: infinitely many pairs sum to 20 (e.g. 15+5, 12+8, 18+2...) → **insufficient alone.**
  2. Statement II alone: infinitely many pairs differ by 4 → **insufficient alone.**
  3. Together: solve simultaneously — A+B=20 and A−B=4 → adding both equations: 2A=24 → A=12, then B=20−12=8. **One single, definite answer (A=12, B=8) — sufficient together.**
  4. **Answer: Both statements together are sufficient.**

**Checkpoint (at 19 min)** — 10 s silent think, cold-call two students:
> *"If Statement I alone already gives you one definite answer, do you even need to check Statement II?"*
> **Answer:** **No** — if I alone is sufficient, the answer is either "Statement I alone is sufficient" or possibly "Either statement alone is sufficient" (only if II also independently works) — you still peek at II only to check for the "Either" case, but you never need to *combine* them once one works alone.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 1 — Whiteboard Race: Sufficient or Not? (19–25 min)

**ALS format:** Paired Whiteboard Race — pairs race to judge whether a single statement is sufficient (not solve for the value), first correct board up wins the round. Chosen to drill the "judge, don't solve" discipline into fast, reflexive habit before Teaching Block B introduces the trickier Either/Neither cases.

**Setup line:**
> *"Pairs, boards up. I'll give you a question and ONE statement. Just tell me: sufficient, or not sufficient? Don't solve for the actual value. First correct board up wins. Three rounds."*

- Round 1: *"What is X? Statement: X + 7 = 15."* → One equation, one unknown, one definite value → **Sufficient.**
- Round 2: *"What is Y? Statement: Y is a positive number less than 10."* → Many possible values (1 through 9) → **Not sufficient.**
- Round 3: *"What is the perimeter of the rectangle? Statement: the length is 8 cm."* → Length alone, no width → **Not sufficient.**

**How it surfaces:** After each round, ask the winning pair to justify their verdict without stating the actual value (for Round 1) — reinforces that the skill is judgment, not calculation.

**Debrief line:**
> *"None of you needed to actually solve Round 1's equation to know it was sufficient — you just needed to see 'one equation, one unknown.' That recognition speed is exactly what this whole topic rewards."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut to 2 rounds (drop Round 3), but always enforce "verdict only, no solving" as the round's actual rule.

---

## Teaching Block B (25–32 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

Covers: the "Either alone sufficient" and "Neither sufficient" cases, worked live.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **"Either statement alone is sufficient" — worked example, live:** *"What is the area of a square?"* Statement I: *"The perimeter of the square is 20 cm."* Statement II: *"The diagonal of the square is 5√2 cm."*
  1. Statement I alone: perimeter=20 → side = 20/4 = 5 → area = 5² = **25**. **Sufficient alone.**
  2. Statement II alone: diagonal=5√2 → side = diagonal/√2 = 5 → area = 5² = **25**. **Also sufficient alone, independently.**
  3. Both statements, checked separately, arrive at the same unique answer through completely different reasoning paths → **Answer: Either statement alone is sufficient.**
- **"Neither statement, even together, is sufficient" — worked example, live:** *"What is the value of N?"* Statement I: *"N is a prime number less than 10."* Statement II: *"N is an odd number less than 10."*
  1. Statement I alone: N could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 → **insufficient alone.**
  2. Statement II alone: N could be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 → **insufficient alone.**
  3. Together: N must be BOTH prime AND odd AND less than 10 → candidates: 3, 5, 7 — **still three possible values, not one.**
  4. **Answer: Neither statement, even together, is sufficient.**
- **Say explicitly:** *"This last case is the one people trust least, because it feels like giving up. But 'still multiple possibilities' is just as valid and just as final an answer as any other — don't force a single value where the information genuinely doesn't allow one."*

**Checkpoint (at 32 min)** — cold-call:
> *"What's the key difference between 'Either alone is sufficient' and 'Both together are sufficient'?"*
> **Answer:** In **"Either alone,"** each statement independently, on its own, already gives the full definite answer. In **"Both together,"** NEITHER statement works alone — you genuinely need to combine them.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 2 — Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal: The Seating Puzzle (32–40 min)

**ALS format:** Silent Solve, Vote-Lock, Then Reveal — students apply the full three-step method to a cross-topic problem (linking back to the Linear Arrangements/Ranking skills from earlier sessions) entirely on their own before the reveal. Deliberately different register from Activity 1's loud paired race (quiet, individual, single big reveal), and closes the course by connecting Data Sufficiency back to the arrangement skills built across the term.

**Setup line:**
> *"On your own, three minutes. Five friends — P, Q, R, S, T — sit in a row of 5 seats, numbered 1 to 5, left to right. Where does R sit?*
> *Statement I: P sits at seat 1, and Q sits immediately next to P.*
> *Statement II: S sits at seat 5, and T sits immediately next to S.*
> *Work through all three steps — I alone, II alone, then together if needed. Write your full reasoning and your final verdict, hold up when I say show."*

Give 3 minutes silent work, then: *"Show me — three, two, one, show."*

**The reveal, step by step:**
1. **Statement I alone:** P=seat1. "Q immediately next to P" — only seat 2 is next to seat 1 → Q=seat2. R could be at seat 3, 4, or 5 — **not determined, insufficient alone.**
2. **Statement II alone:** S=seat5. "T immediately next to S" — only seat 4 is next to seat 5 → T=seat4. R could be at seat 1, 2, or 3 — **not determined, insufficient alone.**
3. **Together:** P=1, Q=2, S=5, T=4 → only seat 3 remains unassigned → **R = seat 3, uniquely determined.**
4. **Answer: Both statements together are sufficient.**

**Debrief line:**
> *"This puzzle used exactly the same seating logic from Session 15, but the question changed completely — instead of 'find everyone's seat,' it was 'do you have enough information to find R's seat.' Same skill, different judgment layered on top. That's Data Sufficiency in one sentence — it doesn't replace what you've learned this whole course, it just asks a new question about it."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut the silent window to 2 minutes but always walk through all three steps explicitly in the reveal (I alone, II alone, together) — skipping the individual checks defeats the entire discipline this topic teaches.

## Classroom Quiz (40–45 min) · Reserved — not yet available

No quiz bank exists yet for Logical Reasoning. Use this slot for instructor-led review — pose one more two-statement problem and have the class vote on which of the five answer options applies before revealing — or fold into Buffer and end early.

---

## Exit Ticket + Homework (45–48 min)

**Exit ticket** (~1 min):

> "What is the value of Z?" Statement I: "Z is a two-digit number." Statement II: "Z is a multiple of 47." Evaluate.
> **Answer:** Statement I alone: many two-digit numbers → insufficient. Statement II alone: two-digit multiples of 47 — only **94** fits (47×2=94; 47×1=47 is not two... wait 47 is two-digit too, so 47 and 94 both qualify) → still two possibilities → insufficient alone. Together: both conditions combined still allow both 47 and 94 → **still two possible values → Neither statement, even together, is sufficient.**

Scan responses on the way out — if the "judge, don't solve" discipline slipped for any student (they solved for Z's exact value instead of counting possibilities), that's worth a quick individual note, since this is the course's final session.

**Homework**

| Task | Note |
|---|---|
| "What is the age of X?" Statement I: "X is 5 years older than Y." Statement II: "Y is 20 years old." Evaluate using all three steps. | Self-check — should land on "Both together sufficient" (or check if II alone plus I alone can combine cleanly) |
| Write your own Data Sufficiency question (any topic) with two statements, designed so the answer is "Either statement alone is sufficient" | Self-check — construction reinforces the hardest case to design correctly |

Tell them: *"That's the full Logical Reasoning course — from clocks and calendars all the way through to judging sufficiency itself. Every topic gave you a different lens for the same underlying skill: read carefully, structure what you're given, and reason your way to a conclusion you can actually defend."*

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Why students hold it | Correct it live by |
|---|---|---|
| The goal is to find the actual answer, not just judge sufficiency | Every prior topic in the course ended with a specific value | Poll Q2 + Teaching Block A's explicit "judge, don't solve" framing, reinforced in Activity 1 |
| "Multiple possible values, but a small number of them" still counts as sufficient | Confuses "narrowed down" with "uniquely determined" | Teaching Block B's Neither-sufficient example (3, 5, 7 — narrowed but not unique) |
| "Either alone sufficient" means the two statements say the same thing | Doesn't realise they can reach the same answer via totally different reasoning paths | Teaching Block B's square-area example, two independent derivations |
| If Statement I is sufficient, you should still combine it with Statement II "to be sure" | Habit of wanting to double-check with all available information | Checkpoint at 19 min's explicit "no need to combine once one works alone" rule |
| "Neither sufficient" feels like an incomplete or wrong answer | Feels like giving up rather than a valid, defensible conclusion | Teaching Block B's explicit "just as valid an answer" reassurance |

GitBook's "Problem Solving" sub-page is image-only and unrecoverable. The Hook (divisible by 2 and 3 → divisible by 6) and the five standard answer options directly match the source's own stated content; **the source's own quantitative worked example (LCM/ratio/HCF) contains an internal inconsistency** in the extracted text (the ratio appears to be stem-given information, which would make Statement I alone already sufficient, contradicting the source's "individually insufficient" claim) — this plan uses fresh, independently-verified examples for all five answer-option types instead, flagged at the top of this file.
- **50-min format: 45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling, 2 min flex).
- **Two ALS activities, different registers:** Activity 1 (Paired Whiteboard Race) is fast/competitive, single-statement judgment only; Activity 2 (Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal) is quiet/individual, full three-step method, deliberately reusing Session 15's seating-arrangement skill to close the course on a cross-topic note.
- **This is the final session of the 24-session Logical Reasoning course.** The Exit Ticket and closing line both intentionally reference the course as a whole, not just this session.
