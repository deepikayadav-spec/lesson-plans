## Classroom Settling (0–3 min) · Buffer — not instructional

Board ready. Draw a large compass rose (N/E/S/W plus NE/SE/SW/NW) on the board.

## Warm-Up Poll — Diagnostic (3–7 min) · ALS: Polling

> New topic — Directions doesn't build directly on Ranking, so this poll is diagnostic, not retrieval.

Say: *"Five quick questions before we start."*

**Q1.** If you're facing North and turn right (clockwise) 90°, which direction do you now face?
`A` South · `B` East · `C` West
→ *Read:* B is correct — foundational for everything today.

**Q2.** What's the angle between North and North-East?
`A` 30° · `B` 45° · `C` 90°
→ *Read:* B is correct.

**Q3.** Have you used a map app (Google Maps, etc.) and gotten momentarily confused about which way you're facing?
`A` Yes, often · `B` Occasionally · `C` Never
→ *Read:* Most will say A/B — great real-world tie-in for the Hook.

**Q4.** Quick guess: you walk 5 km North, turn right and walk 3 km, then turn left and walk 4 km. Which direction do you end up facing?
`A` North · `B` East · `C` South · `D` West
→ *Read:* A is correct. Don't confirm — this is the Hook's riddle, answered fully in Teaching Block A.

**Q5.** If you walk 6 km one direction, then turn 90° and walk 8 km, roughly how far is the straight-line distance back to where you started?
`A` 14 km (just add them) · `B` 10 km · `C` 2 km
→ *Read:* B is correct (Pythagorean 6-8-10 triple) — most will guess A; that's the exact misconception Teaching Block B corrects.

**Running it** — poll tool, ~45 s per question, ~3.75 min total.

---

## Hook (7–10 min)

Say: *"You walk 5 km North. You take a right turn and walk 3 km. Then you take a left turn and walk 4 km. Which direction are you facing right now?"*

Take 2–3 shouted guesses, write them on the board without confirming or denying.

> *"This is exactly how map apps and delivery drivers think, just without a screen to check. By the end of today you'll track this kind of movement in your head, find exactly how far someone ends up from their starting point, and calculate the shortest way back — using nothing but a right triangle."*

## Teaching Block A (10–19 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

<!-- placement: inferred grouping — no source deck; grouped from GitBook Concept Explanation extraction -->
Covers: compass basics → turn-tracking rules → solving the Hook riddle live.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Compass basics.** Four cardinal directions: **North, East, South, West** — 90° apart. Four intermediate directions: **NE, SE, SW, NW** — each 45° from its two neighbouring cardinals. Point to the board compass rose throughout.
- **Turn-tracking rule, write on the board:**
  - **Right turn (clockwise):** N → E → S → W → N
  - **Left turn (counter-clockwise):** N → W → S → E → N
  - *"Memorise this one cycle in each direction, and you can track any sequence of turns without a diagram — though drawing one is always a safe fallback."*
- **Solving the Hook, live, step by step:**
  1. Start facing **North**. Walk 5 km North — still facing **North**.
  2. **Right turn** → from North, a right turn means **East**. Walk 3 km East — still facing **East**.
  3. **Left turn** → from East, a left turn means **North** (using the left-turn cycle: E → N). Walk 4 km North.
  4. **Final direction facing: North.** ✔ matches the poll Q4 intuition for most students.
- **Say explicitly:** *"Notice the distance walked (5 km, 3 km, 4 km) never mattered for this question — only the turns did. That's a huge time-saver: if a question only asks 'which direction,' ignore the distances completely."*

**Checkpoint (at 19 min)** — 10 s silent think, cold-call two students:
> *"You start facing East. You turn left, then turn left again. Which direction do you face now?"*
> **Answer:** East → left → **North** → left → **West**.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 1 — Human Compass (19–25 min)

**ALS format:** Physical Demo / Kinesthetic Modeling — the whole class stands up, picks a starting facing direction, and physically turns left/right as the instructor calls out a sequence, landing on a final direction together. Chosen because direction-tracking is inherently spatial, and full-body turning makes the "right = clockwise, left = counter-clockwise" rule impossible to forget.

**Setup line:**
> *"Everyone stand up, face the front of the room — that's your North. I'll call out a sequence of turns and distances. Turn your whole body each time. At the end, tell me which direction you're facing."*

- Sequence 1: *"Turn right. Turn right again."* → North → East → **South**. Check as a class — does everyone agree they're now facing the back of the room?
- Sequence 2: *"Face North again. Turn left. Turn right. Turn right."* → North → West → North → **East**.
- Sequence 3 (harder — mixed with a "walk" instruction that shouldn't affect facing): *"Face North. Walk forward. Turn right. Walk forward. Turn left. Walk forward."* → North → East → North (matches the Hook exactly) — confirm the class lands facing the front-side wall again.

**How it surfaces:** After each sequence, do a quick visual scan — anyone facing a different wall than the majority has made a tracking error; ask them to redo the sequence out loud.

**Debrief line:**
> *"Your body just did in five seconds what would take a full minute to draw and calculate on paper. If you ever lose track on an exam, mentally 'turn your own body' the same way — it's faster than you think."*

**Cut rule:** If space is tight, do the turns as hand gestures (pointing) instead of full-body turns, but keep everyone participating simultaneously — the point is kinesthetic, shared tracking, not a spectator demo.

## Teaching Block B (25–32 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

Covers: net displacement (position, not facing), direction interchange puzzles, and Pythagorean shortest-distance.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Final position vs. final direction — a different question.** *"Facing direction" asks which way you're looking. "Final position" asks where you physically ended up relative to the start. Use a grid: mark the start at (0,0), and track net movement along the N-S axis (y) and E-W axis (x) separately.
- **Direction interchange puzzles.** Sometimes a question redefines the compass: *"If South becomes East, what does West become?"* Solve by figuring out the rotation being applied — South (normally opposite North) is now labelled East, which is a 90° counter-clockwise relabeling of the whole compass. Under that same rotation: North → West, West → South, East → North.
  - **Worked answer:** *"West becomes South."*
- **Shortest distance — Pythagorean theorem.** For any L-shaped (two-leg, perpendicular) path, the straight-line distance back to the start is **√(leg₁² + leg₂²)**.
- **Worked example, live (from the source, verified):** *"A person walks 6 km East, then 8 km North. What's the shortest distance back to the starting point?"*
  - Distance = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = **10 km**.
- **Say explicitly:** *"Directly relates to poll Q5 — most people's gut instinct is to just add the legs (6+8=14 km). That's wrong. The straight-line shortcut is always shorter than the path actually walked, and Pythagoras is how you calculate exactly how much shorter."*

**Checkpoint (at 32 min)** — cold-call:
> *"A person walks 9 km South, then 12 km East. What's the shortest distance back to the start?"*
> **Answer:** √(9² + 12²) = √(81+144) = √225 = **15 km**.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 2 — Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal: The Full Path (32–40 min)

**ALS format:** Silent Solve, Vote-Lock, Then Reveal — students work a multi-step problem combining turn-tracking AND Pythagorean distance on their own before the answer is revealed. Deliberately different register from Activity 1's loud full-class physical demo (quiet, individual, single big reveal), and combines both halves of today's session into one problem.

**Setup line:**
> *"On your own, two minutes. You start facing North. Walk 8 km. Turn right, walk 6 km. What direction are you now facing, and what's the shortest distance back to your starting point? Write both answers, hold them up when I say show."*

Give 2 minutes silent solo work, then: *"Show me — three, two, one, show."*

**The reveal, step by step:**
1. **Direction facing:** Start North, walk 8 km (still North), turn right → **facing East**.
2. **Shortest distance:** the two legs (8 km North, 6 km East) are perpendicular, so distance = √(8² + 6²) = √(64+36) = √100 = **10 km**.
3. *"Notice — this is the exact same 6-8-10 triangle from Teaching Block B, just with the legs swapped. Recognising common triples like 3-4-5 and 6-8-10 saves real time on an exam."*

**Debrief line:**
> *"Direction-facing and shortest-distance are two separate questions hiding in the same problem. Today you learned to answer both from a single path description — that's the real skill exams are testing."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut the silent window to 90 seconds but always reveal both parts (direction AND distance) — the combination is the point of this activity.

## Classroom Quiz (40–45 min) · Reserved — not yet available

No quiz bank exists yet for Logical Reasoning. Use this slot for instructor-led review — pose one more interchange puzzle (e.g. "If North becomes South, what does East become?") and solve together — or fold into Buffer and end early.

---

## Exit Ticket + Homework (45–48 min)

**Exit ticket** (~1 min):

> A person walks 5 km West, then 12 km North. What's the shortest distance back to the starting point?
> **Answer:** √(5² + 12²) = √(25+144) = √169 = **13 km**.

Scan responses on the way out — if the Pythagorean step is shaky, revisit briefly at the start of Session 11.

**Homework**

| Task | Note |
|---|---|
| You start facing South. Turn left, turn left, turn right. Which direction do you face? | Self-check using the turn-tracking cycles from Teaching Block A |
| If East becomes South, what does North become? | Self-check using the interchange/rotation logic from Teaching Block B |

Tell them: *"Directions is about tracking movement with logic, not memorising a map. Session 11 moves into Coding and Decoding — starting with Number Series, a completely different kind of pattern-spotting."*

## Buffer (48–50 min) · Flex — not instructional

Unscheduled on purpose. End early if reached with time on the clock.

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Why students hold it | Correct it live by |
|---|---|---|
| Distances mentioned in a "which direction" question matter for the answer | Assumes every number in a word problem must be used | Teaching Block A's explicit "distances didn't matter here" callout |
| Shortest distance = sum of the two legs walked | Natural instinct to just add up the path | Poll Q5 + Teaching Block B's explicit Pythagorean correction |
| "Final direction facing" and "final position" are the same question | Both involve directions, feels like one concept | Teaching Block B's explicit distinction with the grid framing |
| Direction interchange puzzles need memorising every possible swap | Feels like a new fact per question | Teaching Block B's "it's just a rotation, work out the rotation" framing |
| Left/right turns are the same rule regardless of your current facing direction | Doesn't track that the cycle continues from wherever you currently face, not always from North | Activity 1's Human Compass, especially Sequence 2's mixed left/right sequence |

## Instructor Notes

- **Data note:** no source slide deck exists. Content sourced from GitBook Concept Explanation/Introduction/Closure text extraction. GitBook's "Problem Solving" sub-page is image-only and unrecoverable — all worked/practice problems in this plan are **instructor-authored**, though the Hook riddle and the 6-8-10 Pythagorean example directly match the source's own stated figures.
- **50-min format: 45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling, 2 min flex).
- **Two ALS activities, different registers:** Activity 1 (Human Compass) is loud/physical/whole-class; Activity 2 (Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal) is quiet/individual, combining both halves of the session's content.
- **First and only session for this topic** (Directions is a single-session topic per the course structure) — warm-up poll is diagnostic, not retrieval.
- **The direction-interchange rotation logic (Teaching Block B) is instructor-derived** <!-- placement: inferred --> from the source's example ("If South becomes East, what does West become?") — the source states the example but not its resolved answer; this plan works it out explicitly as a 90° counter-clockwise compass relabeling (West → South) and shows the reasoning, not just the result.
