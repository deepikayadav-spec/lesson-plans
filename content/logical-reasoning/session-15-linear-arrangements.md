**Duration** 50 min total — **45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling at the start, 2 min flex at the end) · **Topic** Seating/lineup terminology (extreme, immediate, adjacent, between), and multi-clue solving strategy for a single row · **Prerequisite** None specific — first session of the Data Arrangements topic
**Session type** Lecture + guided practice. No source slide deck — content from GitBook Concept Explanation text. No classroom quiz bank yet — 5-min slot reserved at end. GitBook "Problem Solving" page is image-only and unrecoverable — all practice puzzles below are instructor-authored. · **Format** 50-min recalibrated, 2 ALS activities

**⚠️ Sequencing note:** the source's own Introduction text references "Blood Relations" as already covered before this session, while the site's course order (and the Circular Arrangements source page's own recap list) places Data Arrangements *before* Blood Relations. This plan follows the site's course order — Linear Arrangements (Session 15) before Blood Relations (Sessions 17–18) — treating the source's internal reference as the inconsistency, not the nav order.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Define and correctly apply the terms extreme left/right, immediate left/right, adjacent, and between. *(REMEMBERING)*
2. Convert a clue sentence directly into a fixed or partial position on a row grid. *(APPLYING)*
3. Solve a multi-clue linear arrangement by fixing definite positions first, then working outward. *(APPLYING)*
4. Distinguish "immediate" positioning from general left/right positioning, a common source of error. *(EVALUATING)*

## Classroom Settling (0–3 min) · Buffer — not instructional

Board ready. Draw a row of 6 blank position slots (1 through 6) for tracking arrangements all session.

---

## Warm-Up Poll — Diagnostic (3–7 min) · ALS: Polling

> New topic — Data Arrangements doesn't build directly on Coded Language, so this poll is diagnostic, not retrieval.

Say: *"Five quick questions before we start."*

**Q1.** If A is "at the extreme left" of a row, which position is A in?
`A` Position 1 · `B` The middle position · `C` Could be anywhere on the left half
→ *Read:* A is correct — "extreme" means the very first/last slot, not a general area.

**Q2.** If B is "immediately to the right of A," and A is in position 3, where is B?
`A` Position 4 · `B` Somewhere to the right of position 3 · `C` Position 5
→ *Read:* A is correct — "immediate" means the very next slot, no gap.

**Q3.** Have you solved a "seating in a row" logic puzzle before (school, coaching, mock test)?
`A` Never · `B` Once or twice · `C` Regularly
→ *Read:* If mostly A, spend extra time on terminology before speeding into multi-clue puzzles.

**Q4.** Six friends line up for a photo: A is at the left end, C is at the right end, B is immediately right of A. Can you picture the lineup so far?
`A` Yes, clearly · `B` Somewhat · `C` Not yet
→ *Read:* Seeds the Hook directly — most positions (3,4,5) remain unknown from just these three clues, which is the point.

**Q5.** How comfortable are you tracking a puzzle using a grid/diagram instead of just reading the clues in your head?
`A` Very uncomfortable · `B` Okay with practice · `C` Comfortable
→ *Read:* If mostly A, lean hard on the board grid throughout today's session.

**Running it** — poll tool, ~45 s per question, ~3.75 min total.

## Hook (7–10 min)

Say: *"Six friends are standing in a row for a group photo. A is at the left end. C is at the right end. B is standing immediately to the right of A. Sketch or picture the lineup — go."*

Give 30 seconds, then draw it together on the board: position 1 = A, position 2 = B, position 6 = C, positions 3-4-5 still unknown.

> *"Notice — you just solved your first Linear Arrangement question, and you also just discovered its biggest trap: three clues fixed three positions, but three people are still a total mystery. Today's session is entirely about that gap — how to fix what you can, and reason through what's left."*

## Teaching Block A (10–19 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

<!-- placement: inferred grouping — no source deck; grouped from GitBook Concept Explanation extraction -->
Covers: core setup and terminology, worked directly against the Hook's own lineup.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Core setup.** People arrange in a single row, typically read left to right (as if facing North), with positions numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on.
- **Key terminology, write all five on the board:**
  - **Extreme Left/Right** — the very first or very last position, no exceptions.
  - **Immediate Left/Right** — the direct neighbour, with zero gap in between.
  - **Adjacent** — side-by-side, same meaning as "immediate" but usually phrased as a relationship between two named people rather than a position.
  - **Between** — a position sitting in the middle of two named people (could be one or more valid arrangements unless further constrained).
  - **Not** — a negative clue, used to *eliminate* a position rather than fix one — just as powerful as a positive clue.
- **Worked examples, live, against the Hook's lineup:**
  - "A is at the extreme left" → **Position 1 = A.**
  - "C is at the extreme right" → **Position 6 = C.**
  - "B is immediately right of A" → since A=1, **Position 2 = B.**
- **Say explicitly:** *"Three clues, three fixed positions, but three people (positions 3, 4, 5) are still completely open. That's normal — not every clue set fixes everyone. Today's second half is about handling exactly that gap."*

**Checkpoint (at 19 min)** — 10 s silent think, cold-call two students:
> *"'E is between D and F' — what are the two possible arrangements?"*
> **Answer:** **D_E_F or F_E_D** — "between" alone doesn't tell you which side D or F is on.

---

## ⚡ ALS Activity 1 — Human Lineup (19–25 min)

**ALS format:** Physical Demo / Kinesthetic Modeling — 5–6 student volunteers physically stand in a row and reposition themselves live as the instructor reads out clues one at a time, with the rest of the class checking each move against the board grid. Chosen because linear arrangement is inherently spatial, and physically watching people take positions (and sometimes having to shift) makes "immediate" versus "somewhere to the side" impossible to confuse.

**Setup line:**
> *"I need five volunteers. Stand loosely at the front — don't arrange yourselves yet. I'll read clues one at a time, and after each one, physically move into position. Everyone else checks the grid on the board."*

Read clues one at a time, pausing for the volunteers to move and the class to confirm each step:
1. *"P, you're at the extreme left."* → P moves to position 1.
2. *"T, you're at the extreme right."* → T moves to position 5.
3. *"R, you're immediately to the right of P."* → R moves to position 2.
4. *"S, you're adjacent to T."* → S moves to position 4 (the only open slot next to T).
5. *"Q, you're between R and S."* → Q moves to position 3, the only slot left.

Final lineup: **P, R, Q, S, T.**

**How it surfaces:** After each clue, ask the class: *"Could this person have gone anywhere else, given what we know so far?"* — this reinforces that some clues fully fix a position immediately, while others only narrow it down until later clues finish the job.

**Debrief line:**
> *"Watch how the order we solved this in wasn't the order the clues were given — extremes and immediates went first because they're certain, and 'between' went last because it needed the other positions filled in first. That ordering discipline is the whole strategy."*

**Cut rule:** If volunteers aren't available or space is tight, do this with 5 labelled objects (books, cups) moved by the instructor on a table instead — but keep the "one clue at a time, physically move, then check" rhythm intact.

## Teaching Block B (25–32 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

Covers: the four-step multi-clue solving strategy, applied to a harder 6-person puzzle.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Four-step strategy, write on the board:**
  1. **Read all clues once** before drawing anything.
  2. **Fix definite positions first** — extremes and any clue that pins someone to an exact number.
  3. **Use a visual grid** (positions 1 through however many) and fill in as you go.
  4. **Mark possibilities, revisit earlier clues** as later clues narrow things down — don't expect to solve top-to-bottom in one pass.
- **Worked example, live, 6 people (A, B, C, D, E, F):**
  1. A is at the extreme left.
  2. F is at the extreme right.
  3. C is immediately to the right of A.
  4. D is adjacent to F.
  5. B is between C and E.
  6. E is immediately to the left of D.
  - **Solve, step by step:** A=1 (clue 1). F=6 (clue 2). C=2 (clue 3, immediately right of A). D is adjacent to F(6), only open neighbour is position 5 → D=5 (clue 4). E is immediately left of D(5) → E=4 (clue 6). B is between C(2) and E(4) → only position 3 fits → B=3 (clue 5).
  - **Final arrangement: A, C, B, E, D, F.**
- **Say explicitly:** *"Notice we didn't solve clue 5 until clues 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were already locked in — 'between' clues almost always come last, because they depend on other positions already being fixed."*

**Checkpoint (at 32 min)** — cold-call:
> *"In the arrangement above, who is immediately to the left of D?"*
> **Answer:** **E** (position 4, D is position 5).

## ⚡ ALS Activity 2 — Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal: Six-Clue Challenge (32–40 min)

**ALS format:** Silent Solve, Vote-Lock, Then Reveal — students solve a fresh 6-person, 6-clue puzzle entirely on their own before the answer is revealed. Deliberately different register from Activity 1's loud physical demo (quiet, individual, single big reveal), and forces the full four-step strategy without a volunteer walking them through it live.

**Setup line:**
> *"On your own, three minutes. Six people: A, B, C, D, E, F. Clues:*
> *1. A is at the extreme left. 2. F is at the extreme right. 3. C is immediately right of A. 4. B is between C and E. 5. E is immediately left of D. 6. D is adjacent to F.*
> *Find the full arrangement, left to right. Write it out, hold it up when I say show."*

Give 3 minutes of silent solo work, then: *"Show me — three, two, one, show."*

**The reveal, step by step:**
1. A = 1 (clue 1). F = 6 (clue 2). C = 2 (clue 3).
2. D is adjacent to F(6) → D = 5 (clue 6, only open neighbour).
3. E is immediately left of D(5) → E = 4 (clue 5).
4. B is between C(2) and E(4) → only position 3 fits → B = 3 (clue 4).
5. **Final arrangement: A, C, B, E, D, F.**

**Debrief line:**
> *"Same six clues as Teaching Block B, just reordered on the page — and the solve order you needed was identical: extremes and immediates first, 'between' last. If you solved this by reading top to bottom instead of by certainty, that's worth noticing for next time."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut the silent window to 2 minutes but always show the full step-order reasoning in the reveal — the *order* of solving is the actual lesson, not just the final arrangement.

## Classroom Quiz (40–45 min) · Reserved — not yet available

No quiz bank exists yet for Logical Reasoning. Use this slot for instructor-led review — pose one more multi-clue puzzle with a "Not" (negative) clue included and solve together — or fold into Buffer and end early.

---

## Exit Ticket + Homework (45–48 min)

**Exit ticket** (~1 min):

> Five people, P/Q/R/S/T. P is at the extreme left. T is at the extreme right. R is immediately right of P. Q is immediately left of T. Where does S go, and where is it?
> **Answer:** P=1, R=2, T=5, Q=4 → only position 3 remains → **S = position 3**, giving P, R, S, Q, T.

Scan responses on the way out — if the "fix definites first" ordering isn't sticking, revisit briefly at the start of Session 16.

**Homework**

| Task | Note |
|---|---|
| Solve: 6 people, A extreme left, F extreme right, B immediately right of A, E immediately left of F, "C is not adjacent to A," D is between B and C | Self-check — includes a "Not" clue, practising negative elimination |
| Sketch your own 5-person linear arrangement with 4 clues, then solve it yourself the next day without looking at your notes | Self-check — construction reinforces the solving order |

Tell them: *"You've now mastered rows. Session 16 breaks the row into a circle — Circular Arrangements — where left and right stop meaning the same thing for everyone, depending on which way people face."*

## Buffer (48–50 min) · Flex — not instructional

Unscheduled on purpose. End early if reached with time on the clock.

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Why students hold it | Correct it live by |
|---|---|---|
| "Immediate" and general "left/right" mean the same thing | Casual English use blurs the distinction | Poll Q2 + Teaching Block A's explicit terminology definitions |
| Clues should be solved in the order they're given | Natural reading habit (top to bottom) | Teaching Block B + Activity 2's explicit "certainty order, not reading order" framing |
| "Between" always gives one unique answer | Doesn't recognise the D_E_F / F_E_D ambiguity without more clues | Checkpoint at 19 min, explicit dual-arrangement example |
| A "Not" clue is weaker than a positive clue | Feels less informative because it doesn't directly place anyone | Teaching Block A's explicit "just as powerful" framing + homework's negative-clue puzzle |
| Every clue set will fully determine everyone's position | Assumes puzzles are always "solvable to completion" | Hook's own 3-clue lineup, left deliberately incomplete on purpose |

## Instructor Notes

- **Data note:** no source slide deck exists. Content sourced from GitBook Concept Explanation/Introduction/Closure text extraction. GitBook's "Problem Solving" sub-page is image-only and unrecoverable — all worked/practice puzzles in this plan are **instructor-authored**, though the terminology definitions and the six-friends-photo Hook directly match the source's own stated examples.
- **⚠️ Sequencing discrepancy resolved for this build:** see the note at the top of this file — this plan places Data Arrangements before Blood Relations, following the site's course order and the Circular Arrangements source page's own recap list, not the Linear Arrangements source page's internal "we've already covered Blood Relations" reference.
- **50-min format: 45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling, 2 min flex).
- **Two ALS activities, different registers:** Activity 1 (Human Lineup) is loud/physical/volunteer-led; Activity 2 (Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal) is quiet/individual, using the identical clue set from Teaching Block B (reordered) to reinforce the solving-order lesson without introducing new content.
- **First session of the Data Arrangements topic** — warm-up poll is diagnostic, not retrieval.
- Classroom Quiz slot reserved-empty per site convention.
