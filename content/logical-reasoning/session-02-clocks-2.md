## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. State how many times the hands coincide, form 180°, and form 90° in a 12-hour period (11, 11, 22 respectively). *(REMEMBERING)*
2. Derive the time of coincidence between any two given hours using (H × 60)/11. *(APPLYING)*
3. Solve "when are the hands opposite/perpendicular" problems using the same base formula with θ fixed at 180°/90°. *(APPLYING)*
4. Work backwards from a stated angle to find the possible time(s), recognising when more than one time fits. *(ANALYZING)*
5. Judge when a formula-based approach is required versus when a quick shortcut suffices. *(EVALUATING)*

## Warm-Up Poll — Retrieval Practice on Session 1 (3–7 min) · ALS: Polling

Say: *"Five quick ones from last session — no notes."*

**Q1.** What's the minute hand's speed in degrees per minute?
`A` 0.5° · `B` 6° · `C` 12° · `D` 30°
→ *Read:* If B is weak, spend extra time re-deriving before moving to new content.

**Q2.** What's the angle between the hands at 6:00?
`A` 90° · `B` 150° · `C` 180° · `D` 360°
→ *Read:* C should dominate — quick confidence check on the basic formula.

**Q3.** "15 minutes to 6" translates to which time?
`A` 6:15 · `B` 5:45 · `C` 5:15 · `D` 6:45
→ *Read:* B is correct. If weak, this misconception from Session 1 hasn't stuck — flag for a 30-second re-drill before Teaching Block A.

**Q4.** At 4:50 (from last session's exit ticket), was the final angle 155° or did it need a reflex adjustment?
`A` 155° final, no adjustment · `B` Needed 360−155 adjustment
→ *Read:* A is correct. Tests whether the "only adjust if >180°" rule stuck.

**Q5.** Today we're asking: at what *exact* time do the hands sit exactly on top of each other? How many times does that happen in 12 hours — guess a number.
`A` 12 · `B` 11 · `C` 24 · `D` 1
→ *Read:* Most will guess A (12) — that's the exact misconception today's session corrects. Don't reveal B yet.

**Running it** — poll tool, ~45 s per question, ~3.75 min total.

## Hook (7–10 min)

Say: *"Quick show of hands from Q5 — who said 12 times? That's the natural guess, and it's wrong. The hands overlap only 11 times in 12 hours. Today you'll find out exactly why, and exactly when each one happens — down to the second."*

Draw a 12-hour clock face on the board. Say: *"Between 12:00 and 1:00, the hands overlap once, right at 12:00 itself. But watch what happens between 1:00 and 2:00 — does it happen exactly at some '1-something'? By the end of today, you'll compute that exact moment in under 30 seconds."*

## Teaching Block A (10–19 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

<!-- placement: inferred grouping — no source deck; grouped from GitBook Concept Explanation extraction -->
Covers: why coincidence happens 11 times, not 12 · the coincidence-time formula · opposite-hands (180°) case.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Why 11, not 12.** In 12 hours, the minute hand makes 12 full revolutions while the hour hand makes exactly 1. Relative to the hour hand, the minute hand "laps" it 12 − 1 = **11 times**. This is the key insight — write it exactly like that on the board, it directly answers the Hook.
- **Coincidence formula.** Set the angle formula to 0: 30H = (11/2)M, so **M = (60 × H)/11**, where H is the hour you're starting from (e.g. "between 2 and 3" → H = 2).
- **Worked derivation, live, between 2 and 3:** M = (60 × 2)/11 = 120/11 = **10 10/11 minutes ≈ 10 min 55 sec**. So the hands coincide at approximately **2:10:55**.
- **Opposite hands (180°).** Same base formula, set θ = 180°: |30H − (11/2)M| = 180, solve for M. This also happens **11 times in 12 hours** (once per "lap gap," same logic as coincidence, just offset by half a lap).
- **Worked derivation, live, between 5 and 6, hands opposite:** 30(5) − 5.5M = −180 (taking the case where minute hand has moved ahead) → 150 − 5.5M = −180 → 5.5M = 330 → M = 60 — this hits exactly 6:00, a boundary case worth flagging: *"When your answer lands exactly on the hour boundary, sanity-check by testing the neighbouring hour too."* Correct worked instance: between 5 and 6 hands are opposite at M = (30×5 − 180)/5.5 not clean — use board time to let students see that solving 180 = |150 − 5.5M| gives 5.5M = 150+180=330 → M=60 (boundary, effectively 6:00) or 5.5M=150−180=−30 → M=−5.45 (invalid, negative) — so the real answer near 5 o'clock is found by re-anchoring to H=4: 30(4) + 180 = 5.5M → 120+180=300 → M=54.5 → **4:54:30** is when hands are opposite approaching 5.

**Checkpoint (at 19 min)** — 10 s silent think, cold-call two students:
> *"How many times in 12 hours are the hands exactly opposite each other?"*
> **Answer:** **11 times** — same "lapping" logic as coincidence.

## ⚡ ALS Activity 1 — Whiteboard Race: Coincidence Hunt (19–25 min)

**ALS format:** Paired Whiteboard Race — pairs race to compute a coincidence time for an assigned hour window, first correct pair to hold up their board wins the round. Chosen to convert the just-taught formula into fast, repeatable muscle memory before adding the 90°/180° variations in Teaching Block B.

**Setup line:**
> *"Pairs, mini-whiteboards up. I'll call an hour window — you compute exactly when the hands coincide inside it using M = 60H/11. First correct board up wins the round. Three rounds."*

- Round 1: "Between 3 and 4" → M = 60×3/11 = 180/11 ≈ **16 min 22 sec** → 3:16:22
- Round 2: "Between 7 and 8" → M = 60×7/11 = 420/11 ≈ **38 min 11 sec** → 7:38:11
- Round 3: "Between 10 and 11" → M = 60×10/11 = 600/11 ≈ **54 min 33 sec** → 10:54:33

**How it surfaces:** After each round, pick one winning pair to narrate their steps aloud before revealing whether they're correct — this exposes the method, not just the answer, to the rest of the room.

**Debrief line:**
> *"Same formula, three different hours, three different answers — but the *method* never changed. That consistency is exactly what you want walking into an exam."*

**Cut rule:** If running short, cut to 2 rounds (drop Round 3) but always let at least one pair narrate their method aloud.

## Teaching Block B (25–32 min) — TEACH FROM NOTES BELOW

Covers: perpendicular hands (90°, 22×/12h) · reversing angle → time (multiple valid times per angle) · shortcut vs. formula decision rule.

**Beats to emphasise**

- **Perpendicular hands.** Occurs when θ = 90°. Because 90° is "half" of the 180° condition in a sense, and there are two moments per hour-pair where it can occur (hands closing to 90° and hands opening past 90° again), this happens **22 times in 12 hours** (roughly twice per hour, except near the 3/9 boundary hours where it compresses to once).
- **Worked derivation, live, near 3:00 — first 90° moment:** |30(3) − 5.5M| = 90 → |90 − 5.5M| = 90 → two cases: 90 − 5.5M = 90 → M = 0 (that's 3:00 itself) or 90 − 5.5M = −90 → 5.5M = 180 → M ≈ **32.7 min** → second 90° moment is roughly **3:32:44**.
- **Reversing angle to time — the key exam trap.** Given "find the time between 2 and 3 when the hands are 50°," don't assume one answer — the equation |30H − 5.5M| = 50 can yield two valid M values (one where the minute hand is ahead, one where the hour hand is ahead), both inside the same hour window. Always solve both cases: 30H − 5.5M = +50 and 30H − 5.5M = −50.
- **Shortcut vs. formula — decision rule:** use the formula whenever the question gives you an *exact* angle and asks for an *exact* time, or vice versa. Use quick visual estimation only when the question just asks for an approximate comparison ("is the angle closer to 90° or 180°?"). *"Shortcuts estimate. Formulas prove."*

**Checkpoint (at 32 min)** — cold-call:
> *"How many times in 12 hours are the hands exactly perpendicular?"*
> **Answer:** **22 times.**

## ⚡ ALS Activity 2 — Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal: The Two-Answer Trap (32–40 min)

**ALS format:** Silent Solve, Vote-Lock, Then Reveal — deliberately different register from Activity 1's loud paired race (quiet, individual, single reveal). Designed specifically to surface the "only found one of two valid answers" bug, which is the most common real exam mistake on this topic.

**Setup line:**
> *"On your own, two minutes. Between 7 and 8 o'clock, find a time when the hands are exactly 90° apart. Just one answer is fine for now. Write it down, hold it up when I say show."*

Give 2 minutes silent work, then: *"Show me — three, two, one, show."* Note how many distinct answers appear across the room (there should be two clusters if anyone found both cases).

**The reveal, step by step:**
1. Base position: 30 × 7 = 210°.
2. Case 1 (hour hand ahead of minute hand by 90°): 210 − 5.5M = 90 → 5.5M = 120 → M ≈ **21.8 min** → **7:21:49**.
3. Case 2 (minute hand ahead of hour hand by 90°): 210 − 5.5M = −90 → 5.5M = 300 → M ≈ **54.5 min** → **7:54:33**.
4. Both are valid, both sit inside the 7–8 window. *"If you only found one, you're not wrong — you're incomplete. Exams will sometimes ask for 'all' times, or ask you to pick from options where only one of your two answers appears."*

**Debrief line:**
> *"This is the single most common way marks get lost on this topic — not a wrong formula, an incomplete search. Always ask yourself: could there be a second case?"*

**Cut rule:** If running short, skip the silent solo window and solve Case 1 and Case 2 together on the board — but never skip showing both cases exist.

## Classroom Quiz (40–45 min) · Reserved — not yet available

No quiz bank exists yet for Logical Reasoning. Use this slot for instructor-led review — re-run the two-case 90° problem from Activity 2 with a different hour window (e.g. "between 9 and 10"), cold-calling students to find both cases — or fold into Buffer and end early.

---

## Exit Ticket + Homework (45–48 min)

**Exit ticket** (~1 min):

> Between 8 and 9 o'clock, at what time are the hands exactly opposite (180°)?
> **Answer:** 30(8) − 5.5M = −180 → 240 + 180 = 5.5M → M = 76.4 (invalid, over 60) → re-anchor: |240 − 5.5M| = 180 → 5.5M = 60 → M ≈ **10.9 min** → approximately **8:10:54**.

Scan responses — if students only try one case and get stuck, that's the Activity 2 lesson not yet landed; revisit briefly at the start of Session 3.

**Homework**

| Task | Note |
|---|---|
| Find both 90° times between 10 and 11 o'clock | Self-check against the method from Activity 2 |
| Find the coincidence time between 9 and 10 o'clock | Self-check using M = 60H/11 |

Tell them: *"You now have three tools — coincidence, opposite, perpendicular — all from one base formula. Session 3 moves into puzzle territory: clocks that lie, mirror images, and directions."*

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Why students hold it | Correct it live by |
|---|---|---|
| "Hands overlap 12 times in 12 hours" | Natural but wrong assumption — one per hour | Hook's direct callout + Teaching Block A's "11 laps" derivation |
| A reversed angle→time question has only one answer | Formula-solving habit from single-answer algebra problems | ALS Activity 2's two-case reveal |
| 90° happens exactly twice every hour, no exceptions | Overgeneralising the "roughly twice an hour" rule | Teaching Block B note on 3/9 boundary compression |
| Coincidence/opposite/perpendicular need three different formulas | Each was introduced separately, feels like three topics | Explicit "same base formula, different θ" framing throughout |
| Fractional minutes (e.g. 10 10/11) feel like a wrong/messy answer | Students expect clean whole-number answers | Explicit conversion to min:sec shown in every worked example |

GitBook's "Problem Solving" sub-page is image-only and unrecoverable — all worked/practice problems in this plan are **instructor-authored**, built from the verified formulas (coincidence M=60H/11 confirmed against the stated "≈10 min 55 sec between 2 and 3" example in the source).
- **50-min format: 45 min instruction + 5 min buffer** (3 min settling, 2 min flex).
- **Two ALS activities, different registers:** Activity 1 (Paired Whiteboard Race) is fast/competitive/paired; Activity 2 (Silent Solve → Vote-Lock → Reveal) is quiet/individual. Continues the alternation pattern from Session 1.
- **The two-case trap (Activity 2) is the pedagogical core of this session** — protect its time slot above all else if running behind.
- Classroom Quiz slot reserved-empty per site convention — add real questions once a bank exists.
